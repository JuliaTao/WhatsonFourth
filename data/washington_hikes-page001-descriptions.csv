0,Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail,Issaquah Alps,NR,NR,3.90 out of 5,(31 votes) Log in to rate,[],NR,"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.5000,-122.0219/@47.5000,-122.0219,11z/data=?hl=en",366,http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/poo-poo-point-chirico-trail,"Poo Poo Point is a small knoll on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain. The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently, around the 1970s, the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus.From the parking lot, take the obvious trail across the landing field. Be alert for any paragliders who might be coasting in quietly to land. At the eastern edge of the field enter Tiger Mountain State Forest and find yourself on the Chirico Trail.The first part of the trail, with its steep, forested hillside and many stone steps is very picturesque. If it strikes you as akin to stepping into a classical Chinese landscape painting, you are not alone. Appreciate the magic. This steep face of Poo Poo Point is known as the Yah-er Wall. As you continue a steep traverse across the Wall the trees become smaller and more spaced out, and the hillside-but not the trail-becomes less steep.Farther along, impatient hikers have, over the years, cut some of the corners. To minimize erosion please try to follow the official trail.Continue hiking in regenerated forest and, at about 1.6 miles, come to the South Launch Viewpoint. This  open area sometimes is used by paragliders, and it is a good place for a short break while you enjoy the unobstructed view of Mount Rainier, clouds permitting.Then continue on another quarter mile, gaining 140 feet, and reach Poo Poo Point and its North Launch Viewpoint.The gravel road you see arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.The Point is a great spot to sit, have a snack and enjoy the view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible. If your timing is right you can enjoy watching paragliders launch from the steep northwestern face into the sky .There are two picnic tables at the Point, and there is a Clivus toilet. There is no regular water source."
1,Esmeralda Basin (Esmerelda),Snoqualmie Region,NR,NR,4.32 out of 5,(19 votes) Log in to rate,[],NR,"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.4361,-120.9372/@47.4361,-120.9372,11z/data=?hl=en",215,http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/esmerelda-basin,"Esmeralda Basin, found at the end of the North Fork Teanaway Road, affords hikers the opportunity to walk through old forest, meadows brimming with wildflowers, and along rocky hillsides, all while enjoying the striking scenery of the jagged and craggy Esmeralda Peaks. The trail boasts over 75 varieties of wildflowers, evidence of an old mining operation, and vantage points into the Cascades from two different passes - one is unnamed, the other is Fortune Creek Pass.The trail begins at the end of the North Fork Teanaway Road. Follow the trail as it meanders along an old mining road to a junction with the Ingalls Way and Longs Pass Trail (1390) in less than half a mile. Continue straight and wander through trees, then meadows, cross streams, and gain elevation, making long switchbacks as you go. In the summer, flowers are prolific in the meadows and along streams which cascade gently down the often rocky and otherwise dry terrain. The wide, old roadway eventually narrows as the trail climbs higher along the hillside. Eventually, the trail skirts the slopes of Ingalls Peak as it heads northwest. Approximately 3 miles from the trailhead, an intersection with Trail 1226 heads north to a pass overlooking Lake Ann. Taking this trail to the overlook is worthwhile, and adds just about 2 miles to your trip and nearly 500 feet in elevation. Otherwise, continue hiking straight, staying on Trail 1394. It travels the side hill until finally reaching the barren ridge which is Fortune Creek Pass. The views here open west to Hawkins Mountain, Mount Daniel and Hinman to the northwest, and if one scrambles the rocky hill to the south of the pass, Mount Rainier can be seen in the distance beyond Gallagher Head Lake. Of course, Ingalls Peak is showcased immediately to the north, a different view than many hikers get from its more visited other side."

T. Murray Wildlife Area sprawls over the northeastern corner, encompassing both open sagebrush desert and dry pine forest environments, and wonderful blends of the two. As is often the case when hiking in the desert, the best walking route is actually an old road, with optional side trips comprising off-trail rambles whenever you’d like. More than 25 miles of rough dirt roads ramble through this area, with occasional mountain bikes and horses sharing them with hikers. The potential route options are too numerous to list, so consider the following just a teaser to get you started on exploring this glorious desert wildlife haven. Note: Be aware that this area and the access road to hike up into it are typically closed November 1 through April 15 each year to protect wintering elk herds.The large trailhead parking area doubles as a rustic campground, so don’t be surprised if there are campers here taking advantage of the multitude of trails to explore. We suggest you start your exploration with a trek up the area’s namesake canyon, heading west from the trailhead along the old road piercing the heart of Joe Watt Canyon.This road/trail climbs moderately up the canyon, occasionally dipping alongside the small creek that runs through it (fed by a spring near the head of the canyon). The canyon is home to herds of elk, and at times even bighorn sheep can be seen in the area. As you hike, especially from late spring through late summer, keep an eye (and ear) to the ground to make sure you don’t startle a rattlesnake, though it’s far more likely you’ll be startled by the eruption of a quail or even grouse launching itself from the grass right at your feet.At about 2.6 miles, the road passes the skeletal structure of an ancient log cabin. This old settlers home is nestled alongside the small creek in a grassy wildflower pasture. This makes a fine turnaround point, but it’s worth a quarter-mile scramble up the slopes above the cabin to get a better view of the canyon, the homestead property, and the surrounding countryside before working your way back down the canyon."

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there."

For many, this trail is a gateway to other routes that lead to more distant goals, such as the Silent Swamp Loop or the Preston Railroad Grade, or to forest roads that lead to the summit of East Tiger.Begin at the Tiger Summit Trailhead and take the short Connector Trail heading east. It soon crosses the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Rd 4000) and then becomes the NW Timber Trail. Enjoy the surroundings here that are exceptionally green and mossy, and in spring be alert for a few wildflowers.Soon, you will come to a trail junction. This could be confusing because it's not shown on the 2014 or earlier revisions of the Green Trails Tiger Mountain Map. The right fork is the ongoing NW Timber Trail (although in the spring of 2016 the trail sign was reported missing.) Just FYI the left trail fork here, signed ""Master Link Trail,"" is one of several new trails constructed in this corner of the Tigers for joint use by hikers and mountain bikers. Some of these new trails may not be shown on your map, but likely will appear on future map revisions. In the interim, you can find all the new joint-use trails depicted on a map offered by Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance. (Click the Navigation tab to view or download the map.)Stay on the NW Timber Trail, and about 0.5 mi from your trailhead you will pass a very steep hillside, one of the steepest you will see in the Tigers. It's a shoulder of Beaver Hill that you can find on your map. Along the way and in season you will cross small streams that tumble down from the heights (some years, in late summer, they may be dry.)Farther along, the trail enters an area that was logged a few years ago. It's been replanted, and now a few knee-high or taller trees can be seen among the native transitional vegetation. At least it's green and easy on the eyes, and in spring you will find different wildflowers here in this sunnier area than you see in the shady forest near the trailhead.Continuing on, pass junctions with two additional joint use hiker-biker trails, first the Easy Tiger Trail on your right, then the Joy Ride Trail on your left. Stay on the NW Timber Trail, and it will come to an end when you reach the East Side Road (Road 7000,) 2.2 miles from your trailhead. Like many roads in the Tigers, this is a service road intended for use by authorized vehicles so you are unlikely to see much traffic here.When you are ready, you can return the way you came, or can consult your map for other options.Extending Your Hike: For an interesting, but longer and considerably more strenuous hike (8.8 mi RT, 600 ft elevation change,) see Silent Swamp Loop in our hiking guide."

Soon you enter more mature stands of fir and hemlock as the trail swings into long switchbacks up the mountainside. After about a mile of trail reach a junction with the Carbon River Trail and Twin Lake. A short, unmarked trail leads out to lonely Twin Lake, which lacks both a twin and the impressive landscape waiting at Summit Lake.Push on from the junction to one of the steeper sections of the hike, following the trail as it quickly ascends the ridgeline. Roughly 2.5 miles from the trailhead, emerge from the woods into the grassy meadows surrounding Summit Lake. If you’re up for more, the trail splits into a loop, winding around the lake and up to the top of Summit Lake Peak. There is often wildlife found in the meadows, including bear, deer, marmot and elk.The side trail to the Summit Peak is rough, steep and narrow, but the rewards are worth the extra effort. From the top, the deep blue of Summit Lake competes with the white flanks of Mount Rainier. Beyond that, an ocean of mountaintops spreads out in every direction, with far too many peaks to name.Backpacking Tip: There are several campsites available around Summit Lake, offering up more exploration opportunities on the nearby Carbon River and Bearhead Mountain Trails."

The cooling sound of flowing water accompanies hikers across a steel bridge and most of the way up the 2500 feet of elevation gain. The trail is used by both hikers and horseback riders, so it is easy to follow and well-maintained. Near the top, still in the woods, there is an unmarked spur trail going to the left. Keep right, following the horseshoe tracks. Look out for the Dusty Trail veering to the right as you hike to the summit. This trail may not appear on your map, but it is signed. If you take it, you'll pass Dusty Camp and continue to a four-way intersection of the Panjab Trail. Here, the Rattlesnake Trail branches to the left, Indian Corral/Dunlap Spring stretches out ahead of you, and the Mount Misery trail vanishes off your right. This intersection is unmarked, but the detour is worth it -- many downed trees on the Panjab Trail make progress on it laborious at best.

It became part of the Snohomish County Park system in 2000, and now is in the process of returning to the wild state it once was. We hikers can watch this dynamic landscape by following the many trails that run through it. The trails are all well signed and a map can be printed or downloaded to your smartphone from the Snohomish County Parks website. Hike the perimeter trails for a good sampling of the area and a nice hike of about 5 miles. Take a minute to read the trailhead kiosk before you start, then head down the Mainline trail from the parking lot. A short interpretive loop walk along the Whispering Firs trail on the right will give you a nice overview of the plants found along the trails and their role in the ecosystem. Once back on the Mainline trail, walk a short way until you intersect with the Wetland Plateau trail on the left. Turn on this trail and follow this very gentle uphill grade. Here you will notice the red alder in this area. This is the most recently logged area, as alder is the first tree to grow back. Look for salmonberry and red huckleberry in the thicket of deciduous shrubs. Salmonberry has bright magenta-pink flowers in the spring and tasty orange to red berries in summer. Red huckleberry has small bell-like flowers and red berries. It is closely related to the mountain huckleberry found at higher elevations. There has been rumors of a resident bear living in these woods, perhaps you will see him if the berries are ripe.Come to a sign for the Goold overlook, where there is supposed to be a view of Mount Baker. This writer hasn't seen it, but maybe you will be lucky!  Close by is a bench to sit and listen to the birdsong. The Wetland Plateau trail intersects the Southern Traverse trail; head right on the Southern Traverse trail. This section is fairly flat and winds through a more mature second growth forest of western hemlock and western cedar. Notice the decaying alder trunks, now serving as 'habitat' trees. As they decay, these trees provide insects and nesting sites for birds and small mammals. In the spring, watch for clumps of white trillium as you hike through this section.You will soon come to a main intersection with the Forest Ridge and the Lloyd trail, stay on the Southern Traverse. The trail then drops down a little and come to Smokey's bridge, a puncheon bridge skirting a large muddy area that becomes a small pond in winter rains. Who was Smokey, one wonders, perhaps a trail worker that helped on the project? Nothing tells us, there is just the sign.  Head back up a gentle grade and intersect here with the Mainline trail and the Bigleaf trail. Take the Bigleaf trail, named for the bigleaf maple you will find growing in the park. A large spreading multi trunk tree, it is easily identified by the very large leaves that turn golden in the fall. Wander along this trail, enjoying the forest. This is truly a mixed forest, young fir, hemlock and cedar trees mix with vine maple, and alder. Underneath there is a carpeting of western bleeding heart in the spring. The Bigleaf ends in a T with the Red Alder trail. Either way on the Red Alder will take you back to the trailhead, take the left fork for a bit more wandering. This trail will wander through some large Doug fir, second growth trees that are one hundred years old. The forest returns!  You will also see some dying trees here too, western white pine being felled by disease. The bark is black and the dead branches circle the trunk in a whorled pattern. Look carefully, though, seedlings are to be found among the understory of  Oregon grape, salal and swordfern.You may finish your hike by taking the Mainline trail back toward the parking lot or continue exploring if you wish, there are thirteen miles of trail here.  Just off the Mainline trail on your way back there is a nice place for lunch at a spot labeled The Clearing, here you will find a picnic table. If you didn't bring a lunch, the Maltby Cafe, just west of  the crossing of 522 is a local favorite."

Eaten too much bratwurst in Leavenworth and need a walk in the woods to settle your stomach? Want a moderate flat snowshoe with a beautiful winter destination?  The short trail to Hidden Lake adjacent to Lake Wenatchee is the answer to all of these requests. Quite popular in summer, especially when the state park campground is full and the wind is up on the lake. About five years ago the trailhead for this trail was moved up off the Cedar Brae Road from Glacier View Campground and a new trail was constructed with a wide tread, and an easy grade.  The first half-mile is ADA-accessible, as the trail winds up through old-growth fir and large cedars. Challenge kids to find to the two “cave trees”, old cedars where lightning long ago burned out caves into their bases. The trail traverses west providing peek-a-boo views of Lake Wenatchee and Dirty Face Mountain.Just before reaching the lake you will cross an outlet stream with a few old logs used as a bridge. There are a number of picnic spots left of the outlet stream, the main access to the lake is up a small knob after crossing the outlet stream,  On the knob there are a half dozen very large ponderosa pines above the lake edge. If you turn around, back to the lake, and look north, you will see a trail marked by a large ponderosa which has been cut to let the trail pass through. This is the original trail, which goes down to Glacier View campground.  By following this trail down you can turn the hike into a loop, and stretch out the mileage to 2.5 miles total. Glacier view, as the name implies, has an incredible view of Glacier Peak, across Lake Wenatchee and up the White River valley.  You re-cross the outlet stream just above the campground on rocks in the stream, (not recommended early in the season). The only downside to this addition is a short road walk. To get back to the parking lot it is fastest to just walk up the road, about a half a mile, as opposed to retracing your steps. The trail down to Glacier View drops you below the parking area so you will climb an additional 200 feet back for a total of 400 feet.If you are looking for more, there is a very nice out and back trail that follows the lake edge for roughly three-quarters of a mile, below the forest service cabins along the lakeshore. This trail can be found at the east end of the campground.WTA Pro Tip: This trail is snowshoe-able! In winters, Cedar Brae Road is plowed to the end of the pavement. Park here and snowshoe out along the dirt section of the road for a mile, watch for the sign to the parking area on the left, the trail is popular enough that you will often find tracks to follow."

Quickly cross the road (watch for traffic, it’s a busy road on a blind corner) to the marker and you will finally see the trailhead, which is mostly invisible from the road due to brush and low hanging tree branches. The trail immediately descends and disappears from the road into the forest valley. The descent is quick, but not too steep, about 280 feet over 0.4 miles. Wander down and around the couple of well-maintained switchback paths and marvel at the ancient and enormous Douglas fir trees, as well as the hemlock and cedar trees that thrive in the shadow of Mount Rainier. Be sure to note the curious 4-to-6 inch pine cones littering the forest floor and look something like a fat mice.A quarter of a mile down is the first viewpoint of the falls. The falls are not huge, and the volume of water will vary depending on the time of year, but check out the cut of the boulders that make the water path appear to flow almost horizontally before pouring down to the next tier. The trail continues another quarter of a mile which will provide another falls vantage point where you can see it tumble into the Chinook creek. This section of the trail ends at the Eastside trail junction where there are a few simple walk-in only campsites and a pair of footbridges crossing over small but lively creeks that provide a place for rest, contemplation, or a least a few photo ops. If you want to keep hiking, you have some options of varying lengths. You can continue another 1.5 miles to investigate another waterfall on Kotsuck Creek. Owyhigh Lakes is another 2.5 miles beyond that (about five miles from the trailhead), and Sunrise Road is an even further destination (about 10 miles from the trailhead). Otherwise, you can turn around at the footbridge and head back up to your car to complete this lovely one mile roundtrip legstretcher. WTA Pro Tip: If you plan on camping on this trail please check with the rangers for conditions, permits, and regulations before packing your stuff in. You can also visit the National Park Service Mount Rainier webpage to plan your trip. No pass is required if you are just day-hiking or passing through."

On this section, there are a lot of small streams to cross so waterproof boots are a must.Return the way you came, or finish it as a loop, taking the Skyline Trail to Paradise Point, where you can enjoy views of the Goat Rocks, Mount Adams, Mount Hood and St. Helens before heading back down, rejoining the crowds on the steep descent to your car."

At the lake, enjoy the sights and relax for a while. If you backpacked in, stay at the campsites for a sunrise and sunset on the lake.The Annette Lake Trail begins just to the right of an information kiosk and the Asahel Curtis Nature Trail. Start down the trail into the forest of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar. Listen to the sound of Humpback Creek, and in just 0.2 miles, cross over it, pausing here to take in one of the best tumbling falls in Washington. The noise can often drown out any conversation!After the bridge, the trail continues through the forest and passes into an open area, crossing under powerlines, then crossing the Iron Horse Trail at 1.2 miles from the trailhead. The trail now begins a steady elevation gain through the forest with occasional small water crossings that are often surrounded by wildflowers taking advantage of the cool spray. You continue to gain most of the elevation for this hike over the next 1.5 miles. The trail opens up as you traverse several talus slopes offering views of Granite Mountain to the north and Humpback Mountain to the west. These open slopes are also good places to see trillium and glacier lilies coming up through the receding snow of late spring.After the last talus slope you enter the forest for a fairly flat hike to the north shore of Annette Lake. From the lake's edge you can take in Abiel Peak to the southwest and Silver Peak to the east, as well as a waterfall descending into the lake's east shore. The camping area is just a short walk to the east.If you have the time or energy, explore the Asahel Curtis Nature Trail when you return to the trailhead. This 0.5-mile loop is a great one for your camera. The two bridges near the beginning of the trail go over Humpback Creek as the trail leads you through moss-hung trees, swamps of giant skunk cabbage and interpretive signs.WTA Pro Tip: Good places to stop for after-hike socializing and talk about your just completed hike or other adventures include the North bend Bar and Grill, 145 E. North Bend way and Stan's Barbecue in Issaquah, 58 Front Street. Both offer good after-hike food and beverages."

Today, evidence of the Press Expedition can still be found throughout the valley, both in blaze marks and the names of various natural features.Start from the Whiskey Bend trailhead and follow the wide and gentle Elwha River Trail through old-growth forest. At about 1 mile, a short side trail leads to the Eagle's Nest, an overlook of the valley below, and often a good place to see deer, elk and bears. Continue to the junction with Rica Canyon at 1.2 miles and descend towards the river bottom.

The hike to the lake combines the best of mountain rainforests, old-growth, wetlands, and mountain views, yet it is readily accessible. In winter the route lends itself to snowshoeing.The origin of Lake Twentytwo’s distinct name is uncertain, but a leading theory is that nineteenth-century railroad maps listed local creeks numerically; one particular creek and its source lake were assigned “22.” The name stuck, and in 1947 the 790-acre Lake Twenty Two Research Natural Area (RNA) was created, putting an end to logging and allowing future generations to appreciate the remaining old-growth cedars and hemlocks.At the trailhead, set out on a well-maintained track that quickly becomes a mountain rainforest trail. Substantial effort has gone into building a trail that can withstand the perpetual beating from the arch-enemy of all trails, water. Gravel, turnpikes, stone steps, puncheon bridges, and more turnpikes make a sustainable trail surface possible. There is always ""water on trail"" here, but the dampness allows ferns and moss to flourish in the Mountain Loop rainforest, and provides a trail environment fascinating to little ones. The trail climbs steadily through the forest of western hemlock, mountain hemlock, alder, and red cedar. Old-growth hemlock and cedar giants have managed to persist due to the RNA. Substantial segments of the lower trail cross active creekbeds, so plan on wearing footwear appropriate for fording small creeks. At 0.6 miles, there is a bridge crossing over Twentytwo Creek, giving your boots a break from keeping your feet dry. But the ample water supply keeps salmonberry, thimbleberry, bunchberry, arnica, and bleeding heart growing thick all along the way. You are never far from the rush of water, and several waterfalls are located close to the trail. At 1.5 miles, leave the forest and climb a talus slope, where western columbine makes an appearance in the summer. This middle segment offers views of Whitehorse Mountain and Three Fingers on clear days. Trudging onward, reenter the forest at 2.1 miles. Shortly thereafter, the terrain takes on a wetland character, with skunk cabbage blooming in the spring. When you reach the bridge over Lake Twentytwo's outflow, you have traveled 2.7 miles through lush rainforest. Marvel at the sheer northern face of Mount Pilchuck, with its waterfalls and (sometimes) booming avalanches in winter and spring. Take in the reflections of rock, sky, and evergreens on the surface of a pristine alpine cirque.WTA Pro Tip: There is a trail around Lake 22, but please keep to it. The boulder field above may be tempting to scramble, but it is dangerous to navigate. Fatalities have occurred when groups of hikers have ventured up the boulder field."

This makes its peak easy to point out to your friends when you say, ”I was up there.”Mount Ellinor also gives you two trailheads to choose from. The lower trailhead at 2,600 feet welcomes you to the ascent with an easy grade at the outset. The route from the upper trailhead at 3,500 feet starts out with a nearly immediate upward jolt. Both routes show off the skill and diligence of the Mount Rose Trail Crew in improving and maintaining the trails.Note that while a Northwest Forest Pass is required at the upper trailhead, hikers do not need one to access Mount Ellinor from the lower trailhead. From the lower trailhead, you’ll enjoy a 6.2-mile round-trip that starts in old growth. The trail climbs with gentle switchbacks, traces the edge of a recovering clear-cut, then it flirts with a ridge edge. Several ridgeline openings-–one with benches--give broad views across Lake Cushman and far to the southeast.From the upper trailhead, the round-trip is 3.2 miles. The more important figure to note for this route is the 2,444 feet of elevation it gains in the 1.6 miles to the summit. The track ascends a set of stacked switchbacks for 0.3 miles until it meets the lower trail.The trails from the upper and lower trailheads merge at 3,900 feet and from there the trail continues upward at the same character-building grade of the path from the upper trailhead. More switchbacks and many with stairstep risers that add to the grade. The trail moderates briefly at the well-signed junction with the winter climbing route before heading up to the first of several panoramic viewpoints.  Stopping to admire the views at each of these is a great way to catch your breath. The trail breaks out of the trees and rises onto rock-strewn slopes and across gravelly meadows before heading through a notch and continuing upward on the west facing slopes. Take time to contemplate the new view into the southern Olympics.  Just below the summit, the trail swings around to the east facing slopes. The summit area has 360-degree views and is also popular with salt-seeking mountain goats."

Go in the spring when the tread is snow-free and the waterfall is flowing at full volume. But keep in mind, with limited parking at the trailhead, this trailhead can get crowded.The hike starts from a trailhead at the school bus turn-around off SE Mt. Si Road--be sure not to block this turnaround if you're hiking this trail during the week! Also note that the tread consists of loose rock in places, so sturdy shoes or boots will help keep your ankles and feet happy on this hike. If you are hiking with children, keep them close by as there are some steep drop-offs along the trail. Walk around the gate and follow the gently inclining Mount Teneriffe Road for approximately two miles, to an intersection signed for Teneriffe Falls. This is the start of the new trail to the falls. Turn right at this junction and begin climbing. For hikers familiar with the old bootleg trail that was painfully steep and dangerously slippery, the new switchbacked trail is a delight! If you’re looking for a workout, don’t worry, you’ll still get it. Over the next mile, you’ll gain most of the elevation on this hike, approximately 770 vertical feet. Thanks to the work of the Department of Natural Resources and the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway, the new trail makes the effort enjoyable.The 22 switchbacks up to the base of the falls wind in and out of tree cover. Enjoy the second- and third-growth forest you’re walking through and the sounds and sights of the nearby stream flowing from Teneriffe Falls. You might glimpse sections of the old bootleg trail that ran parallel to the stream along the way. Though it may be tempting to explore, please stick to the new trail! It was built to provide a safer route for hikers and to minimize erosion and sediment in the fish-bearing stream. As you near the end of the trail, you’ll get a view of the lower part of Teneriffe Falls. Snap a photo, and then continue up the last couple switchbacks to a viewpoint for the upper falls. You’ll reach this point (unsigned) approximately three miles from the trailhead and 2370 feet in elevation. Due to funding issues, this last section has not been brought up to standards. As a result, DNR does not consider the trail complete. The viewing area is a small, mostly flat area with a steep downhill drop-off, so be careful where you step and where you set your pack. If you choose to scramble down to the level area between the upper and lower falls, be aware of slippery rocks and sketchy hand and foot holds. Both make it difficult to get down and then back up to the trail safely. For groups of three people or fewer, this makes a nice snack or lunch spot. Larger groups should choose a spot down trail to take a break.WTA Pro Tip: If you're interested in extending your hike, it's possible to do so! Return to the junction with the road-to-trail conversion and continue heading up and up. After 2.25 miles of hiking, you'll come to a fork in the trail. The left branch is a trail that accesses the summit of Mount Si, just about 1 mile away. Alternatively, you can stick to the road-to-trail and in another 2.5 miles you'll arrive at the summit of Mount Teneriffe. Hiking all the way to the summit of Teneriffe makes for a 13.8 mile roundtrip hike."

And unlike many trails, which sacrifice peripheral scenery on the journey for the prospect of a grand summit view, the Woody Trail is consistently gorgeous as you wind your way along the Wallace River and approach the nine dazzling falls.  The moderate elevation gain (1300 feet, most of which occurs on a series of switchbacks between the Middle and Upper Falls) might give beginners cause to worry, but you can take comfort in the knowledge that there are still great views to be had at the more accessible Lower and Middle Falls stops. The Middle Falls overlook provides arguably the trail’s most impressive scenery with a panoramic view of the Skykomish River valley and the distant portrait of the Olympic Mountains trailing into the horizon.Wallace Falls (deriving its name from Kwayaylsh, surname of the first homesteaders in the area) trail is in great condition. Although the park sees a lot of foot traffic due to its popularity, the trail remains well maintained and relatively clean thanks in part to maintenance from WTA, who has had work parties attend to this trail over the last four years. There are some sections, especially pushing on from the Middle Falls to Upper Falls, where the way becomes more rugged, but these sections are brief. To begin, find the trailhead just off the parking lot, framed by the information kiosk and the restroom facilities. Trek under a pair of mammoth power lines, which despite doing their level best to ruin potential photo ops of Mount Index and Baring Mountain at the clearing, do not completely remove the grandeur of the view. Continue left, trading the last traces of civilization for the gentle babbling of the Wallace River as you duck under a canopy of aged hemlocks. At the half-mile marker, you will encounter a split in the trail. The path on the right, distinguished by a wooden gate (intended to signal that the trail is hiker-only from here on out), leads to the Woody Trail. The left fork diverts to the old Railroad Grade, a longer bike-accessible path. Bikers and more seasoned visitors may swing left to experience the further delights of the park, including paths that lead north to Lake Wallace, but proceed through the gate on the right to the Woody Trail if you are on foot and desire the compact Wallace Falls experience.From there, trace the Wallace River where you may catch fly fishermen playing hooky from work or any number of introspective visitors enjoying the many benches and natural nooks that the trail provides. Eventually you will break from the river and encounter the trail’s first steep climb. Continue up, encountering diversionary paths for the Amphitheater and the Railroad Grade trail, but stay on the Woody Trail until you reach the Picnic area at the Lower Falls, just two miles from the trailhead. Stop to admire the falls, but push less than half a mile for the prospects of better views at the Middle Falls, which boast the most impressive panoramic sights on the trail. There is no shame calling it a day at the Middle Falls overlook, but the hardcore, spry, or those with something to prove will power up the steepest grade of the trail, a sweat inducing half-mile of switchbacks that lead to the Upper Falls, where the path officially concludes at 2.8 miles.WTA Pro-Tip: Often known for the nine waterfalls, Wallace Falls State Park and the surrounding parks are less well-known for mountain biking, fishing, swimming, boating, kayaking and rock climbing opportunities. Visitors looking to participate in any of the ancillary activities offered should contact the park and inquire into the seasonal availability of these experiences.Dogs are allowed at Wallace Falls, but are required to be leashed at all times. There is a strictly enforced fine for unleashed dogs stemming from a number of incidents where unleashed dogs have been swept over the falls. Please be mindful of the dangers of the park for the safety of you and your pet."
